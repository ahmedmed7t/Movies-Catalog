# Movies-Catalog

## Problem

We need to view movies and be aware with each movie details like movie's name, overview, rating and so on

## Solution

We built an application that consisit of 2 screens the first is shown 3 lists of movies 
first list is sorted by popularity, second one is sorted by movies top rated and the third is sorted by the revenue 
by clicking on any movie it will navigate you to details screen that contains movie poster, name, overview, rating and release date
